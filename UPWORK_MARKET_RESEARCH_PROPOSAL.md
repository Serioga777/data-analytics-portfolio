I have an address in the United Kingdom.

Hello,

I'm based in the UK and would like to help with your eCommerce market research project. I saw you need someone to evaluate customer service, delivery times, packaging quality, and product condition through product reviews.

I'm detail-oriented and comfortable documenting my findings clearly. I understand you want thorough feedback on each parameter you mentioned, and I can provide structured, honest assessments of the entire customer experience from ordering through to delivery.

I've done online shopping plenty of times and know what good customer service looks like versus poor service. I pay attention to how products arrive, whether packaging protects items properly, and if delivery times match what was promised.

I can start immediately and complete this within whatever timeframe you need. The $15 fixed price works for me.

Looking forward to contributing to your research.

Best regards,
Serghei Covalciuc
