LIVING ROOM DESCRIPTION
=======================

This is a living room in what looks like a countryside house or cabin. The room has wood everywhere - the ceiling is made from light-colored wooden boards running across, and the floor is also wooden planks in a medium brown color.

The most interesting part is the left wall. It's painted dark teal (kind of a blue-green color) and has wooden boards nailed in an X pattern on it. These boards look like they frame a doorway that goes to another room, maybe a bathroom or bedroom.

There's a brown leather couch against that teal wall. It's the kind of tan-brown color you see on work boots or saddles. Someone threw a dark gray blanket on one end and a couple of light-colored pillows on it. Nothing fancy, just practical.

In front of the couch sits a simple round coffee table made from light wood - probably pine or birch. It has those angled legs that stick out. Under it is a thick gray rug, looks like it could be made from wool or that rough rope material. The rug sits on top of the wood floor.

On the right side there's a big window with a wooden frame. Through it you can see trees and green plants outside - proper countryside view. The window lets in good natural light during the day.

The ceiling has two black round lights built into it. On the teal wall, there are also two black lamps mounted up high, one on each side of that X-pattern wood decoration.

There's a small plant in a pot near the doorway and what looks like a low wooden cabinet or shelf on the right side. In the corner you can see part of another piece of furniture in that same teal color as the wall.

Everything is pretty simple and functional. The colors are mostly natural - wood tones, that dark teal, brown leather, gray rug, and some cream or off-white accents. It's the kind of room you'd actually use every day, not just for show. Clean but lived-in looking.
