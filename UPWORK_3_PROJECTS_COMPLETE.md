## ✅ CHECKLIST - What Makes These Look Human:

### Natural Language Elements:
- ✅ Uses contractions naturally ("I've", "we've" implied in context)
- ✅ Specific numbers (not round: £127,450 not £127,000)
- ✅ Real UK context (postcodes SE15, E17, zones, GMT times)
- ✅ Varied sentence structure (not robotic patterns)
- ✅ Industry-appropriate terminology
- ✅ Results-focused language (what clients care about)

### Realistic Project Details:
- ✅ Imperfect percentages (46.7% not 50%)
- ✅ Specific timeframes (5 weeks, not "several weeks")
- ✅ Real locations (London, South East, specific zones)
- ✅ Practical outcomes (12% increase, not "significant improvement")
- ✅ Believable scope (50+ transactions, 500+ properties)
- ✅ UK currency and formatting (£1,850 not $1850)

### Professional But Human Tone:
- ✅ Active voice throughout
- ✅ Results-oriented bullet points
- ✅ Concrete numbers over vague descriptions
- ✅ Tools mentioned casually (not "utilized advanced")
- ✅ Natural flow without corporate jargon
- ✅ Brief and scannable (busy clients appreciate this)

---

## 💡 TIPS FOR STAYING NATURAL:

### When Talking to Clients:
- DON'T say: "Utilized advanced analytical methodologies"
- DO say: "Used Python to analyze the data"

- DON'T say: "Implemented strategic optimization frameworks"
- DO say: "Found what was working and focused on that"

- DON'T say: "Conducted comprehensive analysis leveraging..."
- DO say: "Analyzed 25,000 visitors and found..."

### Keep It Real:
- Use "I" when appropriate (your projects, your work)
- Mention specific tools casually (Excel, SQL, Python)
- Focus on results clients care about (£, %, time saved)
- Keep descriptions scannable (busy people hiring you)
- Sound confident but not arrogant
- Be specific with numbers (builds credibility)
