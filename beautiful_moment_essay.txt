BEAUTIFUL MOMENT ESSAY (200 words)
===================================

Last month, I was driving back from town when I pulled over at the old lookout point to watch the sunset. I don't usually stop, but something about the sky that evening made me turn off the engine and just sit there.

The sun was hanging low over the hills, this bright orange ball that you could actually look at without hurting your eyes. The whole sky was painted in layers - deep orange near the sun, then pink, then this pale purple higher up. Some clouds were scattered across, and they looked like they were on fire, glowing orange and pink underneath while their tops stayed gray.

Everything around me changed color too. The fields that are normally just green turned golden. The trees on the ridgeline were dark silhouettes against all that color. Even the inside of my truck had this warm orange glow to it.

It was quiet except for some crows calling in the distance. The air coming through the window was cool, smelled like grass and dust from the fields. I sat there maybe fifteen minutes, watching the colors slowly shift. The orange got deeper, more red, then the sun slipped behind the hills and everything went soft purple and blue.

Simple moment, but it stuck with me.
