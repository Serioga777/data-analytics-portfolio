Hi there,

I'm a UK-based data analyst with hands-on experience building automated data pipelines and connecting them to visualization tools. I saw your project needs someone to help with API integration to Snowflake and PowerBI, which is exactly the kind of work I've been doing.

Here's what I've worked on recently that's relevant:

Web Analytics Pipeline (Python)
I built a pipeline that processes over 25,000 visitor records from multiple traffic sources. The system automatically extracts data, cleans it, and calculates key metrics. The analysis identified a 71.6% conversion improvement opportunity, and I created a 6-chart dashboard to visualize everything. The client could see exactly where to focus their efforts.

E-Commerce Sales Analytics (SQL + Python)
Worked with £1.8M worth of transaction data (4,444 individual sales). Built an ETL pipeline that handles multiple product categories and regions, validates the data, and prepares it for Excel PivotTables. Found insights showing 61.7% revenue growth patterns. The dashboards made it easy to spot which products and regions were performing.

Property Database Integration (SQL)
Created a complete data pipeline for 544 London properties, taking raw CSV files and building a proper SQLite database. Wrote the schema, built complex queries for analysis, and automated the whole workflow. The client used this to identify investment opportunities with 15% better ROI than market average.

You can see all the actual code here: https://github.com/Serioga777/data-analytics-portfolio

Why I think I'd be a good fit:

I've built API integrations before and I'm comfortable with Python for data extraction. I know how to work with custom data sources that need special handling (validation, transformation, dealing with quirks). My SQL and database skills should transfer well to Snowflake. I've created 18+ dashboards, so I understand what makes visualizations useful. Plus I'm UK-based, so we're in the same timezone.

I haven't worked with Snowflake or PowerBI specifically yet, but I learn tools quickly and the core concepts are the same as what I've done with SQLite and other platforms.

Here's how I'd approach your 2-week proof of concept:

Week 1: I'd start by understanding your custom data source and its quirks. Then build the API extraction layer in Python, design the Snowflake schema that fits your data, and get the transformation and validation working properly.

Week 2: Complete the automated pipeline from API to Snowflake, connect it to PowerBI, build the initial dashboards, and document everything so your team can maintain it.

My rate is $65/hour. I can start right away and I'll send you daily updates so you know how things are progressing.

What you'll get from me is clean code that's easy to maintain, proper documentation, and a repeatable process that runs automatically. I always deliver on time.

I'm genuinely interested in this project. Working with custom data sources that have quirks is actually the fun part, and I'd like to add Snowflake and PowerBI to my toolkit.

## Questions to Ask (Optional - shows engagement):

1. "Could you share more details about the quirks in your custom data source? This will help me prepare the right transformation approach."

2. "Do you have existing Snowflake and Power BI licenses I can access, or should I plan for trial/development accounts?"

3. "What's your priority for the proof-of-concept - data accuracy, visualization quality, or automation reliability?"
